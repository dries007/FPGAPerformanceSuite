In the world of small batch hardware production, FPGAs are used to implement functionality that would normally require very expensive custom chips to be produced. Users traditionally rely on the limited and one-sided information provided by manufacturers and their own design experience to chose the right FPGA for the job.

We believe that using custom benchmarks to generate relevant data will empower the user to make better estimates of both the FPGA's performance and the project's required resources. We developed a methodology and implemented software to automate the generation of statistics about FPGAs across different product families and even vendors.

Alongside a number of existing benchmarks, we created a custom benchmark to test our methodology and implementation. Based on the results of these tests we conclude that it provides valuable insight into the performance of the FPGA, at the cost of additional effort and time to select and compute the benchmarks.
