On the eve of my graduation as Master in Industrial Engineering in the wonderful field of electronics and IT, I would like to thank some people for their support over the past few years.

First and foremost I'd like to thank my thesis supervisor Nicolas Huot and Kristof Van Beeck for their help and guidance on this last leg of my journey.

I would also like to thank the friendly colleagues at Antwerp Space, in particular Jo Van Langendonck and Dave Geerardyn, for their help and warm welcoming environment.

Thanks to my sister Lina for trying to get this document as free from spelling mistakes as possible. Lastly I thank my parents for their support throughout my entire school carrier, in particular the very intense preparatory program last year.
