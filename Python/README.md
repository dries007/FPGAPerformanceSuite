# FPGAPerformanceSuite Code

Set this path as a "sources root" in PyCharm, or add it to the `PYTHONPATH` in any other environment, to use the software.

Written to be compatible with Python 3.6.

Run with `python3 -m FPGAPerformanceSuite`, but we recommend you open the project in an decent decent tool (like PyCharm) and go from there.
